# Mixed Excitement for Value-for-Value
There was mixed excitement for value-for-value but most of the hesitation seemed to be conflating Bitcoin with the other Crypto-currencies.

# Community

There's a grand sense of community between all of the large and small businesses and all individuals who attended the event.

# Hallway Track
Bumping elbows with everyone in the hallway track alone is well worth the all-night drive back to St Louis for anyone who's on the fense next year.
